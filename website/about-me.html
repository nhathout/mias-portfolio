        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Art has been a key part of my journey in developing a sense of self and expression. Ever since I can remember, art has been a way for me to communicate emotions and ideas that words could never fully express. Through my work, Iâ€™ve learned to trust the creative process, embracing every step, from the excitement of the beginning to the frustrating middle, when things seem to be going wrong, all the way to the end, when everything comes together into a cohesive piece.  
          <br><br>
          Much of my work explores the intersection between identity and culture, inspired by my global experiences and diverse heritage. I often find that the most rewarding part of creating is pushing through moments of doubt, trusting that even the most chaotic stages have something to offer. I enjoy experimenting with a variety of mediums, including oil paints, acrylic paints, graphite pencils, and black chalk, each offering a unique way to bring my ideas to life.
