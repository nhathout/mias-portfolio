                <p>Description: This pen drawing captures a personal moment between my dad and me, exploring the connection between humans, nature, and their surroundings. By focusing on the simplicity of this interaction, I aim to show how small, meaningful experiences can bring happiness when embraced. The intricate details in the piece reflect the subtle beauty in everyday moments.

                  Mediums Used: This piece began with an H graphite pencil to sketch the figures of my dad and me, laying a foundation for the artwork. I then used various pens to add depth and texture, working section by section.

                <p>Description: This painting captures a moment of my brother sitting on the couch, reflecting his unique personality and how he interacts with his surroundings.

                <p>Description: This sketch brings together three intriguing objects: a sculpture of Zeusâ€™s head, a hand holding a cube, and a mechanical piece. The Zeus head evokes a sense of history and ideals we strive for, while the hand with the cube embodies human creativity and expression. The mechanical element adds a modern twist, representing our complex relationship with technology. Together, these pieces invite viewers to reflect on how we shape our identities in a world influenced by both the past and innovation.

                <p>Description: This painting is a reimagined interpretation of my previous Zeus sketch, rendered in a monochromatic palette using three distinct colors and various shades. I creatively adjusted the positions of the objects, depicting the hand holding the Zeus head while incorporating the gears from the mechanical piece in multiple locations throughout the composition. Through this piece, I wanted to explore the connections between these elements in a way that sparks curiosity and invites viewers to see them in a new light.
                <br><br>
                  Mediums used: This piece began with a sketch using graphite pencils to outline the composition. I then applied acrylic paints in different shades to create a flowing effect that highlights the connections between the objects. The monochromatic palette adds depth and ties the artwork together.</p>
